FUTURE FIXES:

1. Current build does not have media queries for intermediate reponsize sizing (i.e tablet).

ROOM TO IMPROVE:

1. Different font-families for the different "levels" of font-sizes to further differentiate sections.

2. Add a fav-icon.

3. Color scheme is better than the wireframe gray example, but not complimentary enough. Looks simple and elementary.
